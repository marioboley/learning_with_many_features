    "## Setting and Math Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "Our general setting is that we are given a data matrix $X \\in \\R^{n \\times p}$ with\n",
    "\n",
    "* $n$ rows/examples/observations $X_i \\in \\R^m$\n",
    "* $p$ columns/features/predictors $(X^T)_i \\in \\R^n$\n",
    "\n",
    "as well as a target/label/response vector $y \\in \\R^n$. Furthermore, we assume that $p > n$, i.e., we have more features than observations. However, we further assume that the given set of features is unneccesarily large and that the \"true model\" of the data is sparse. That is, we assume there is a subset of features $\\cM_* \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, p\\}$ such that the responses have been generated from the observations according to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\beta^T_* X_i + \\epsilon_i$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "with a sparse model vector satisfying $\\beta_{*,i} \\neq 0$ iff $i \\in \\cM_*$ and random noise $\\epsilon_i$. As we will see below, this setting occurs when we want to model an unknown relationship using a lot of speculative features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due the noise component, there usually won't be a parameter vector $\\beta \\in \\R^n$ such that $X\\beta = y$ exactly. In the terminology of linear algebra, our response vector $y$ won't be in the **range** (column space) of the data matrix, which is denoted\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\range{X} = \\{X\\beta : \\beta \\in \\R^N\\} \\enspace .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have to settle for paramters that approximate the reponses $X\\beta \\approx y$ with some error or **residual** vector $y - X\\beta \\neq 0$. If we assume furthermore that the noise component has been sampled i.i.d. according to a normal distribution with mean zero, the maximum likelihood parameter vectors (as we will see below there can be more than one) $\\beta_\\rm{ml} \\in \\R^p$ are minimising the sum of squared residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - X^T_i\\beta)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which we can write in matrix/vector notation as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\|X\\beta - y\\|^2 = (X\\beta - y)^T(X\\beta - y) \\enspace .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Either from basic geometric considerations are using calculus, we can find that any parameter vector that minimises this objective function must have an residual (error) vector $y - X\\beta$ that is orthogonal to the **range** (column space) of the data matrix, i.e., for all columns we must have that $((X^T)_i)^T(y - X\\beta)=0$. Combining the $n$ linear equations into one system, and using matrix notation, leads to the famous **normal equations**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X^T X\\beta_\\rm{ls} = X^T y \\enspace .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "to describe *all* parameter vectors $\\beta_\\rm{ls}$ that minimise the least squares objective. We emphasise '*all*' here as it turns out that in our setting with $p > n$ the normal equations will have more than one solution."

    "## Example: Identifying the Law of Gravitation from Speculative Features\n",
    "\n",
    "As a running example, let us consider the data-driven discovery of Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F = G\\frac{m_1 m_2}{d}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F$ is the gravitational force acting between two objects, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the first and the second object, $d$ is the distance between the centres of their masses, and $G \\approx 6.674\\times10^{-11}$ is the gravitational constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we don't know yet about the graviational law, but, for great cost, we can sample a few observations of pairs of planets and can *approximately* determine the gravitational force between them. Additionally, we can determine a host of speculative features for each planetary pair that could potentially \"explain\" the magnitude of the gravitational force.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below lists all variables we use in this example. Instead of observing real pairs of planets, we will synthetically sample some data. For each variable the table gives the distribution or formula used to obtain the corresponding value. The first three variables (position and the densities of planet 1 and 2) are latent, i.e., they are used to compute values of the observed features (and will cause some correlation between them) but they will not be directly accessible by our model. The feature variables are numbered according to their column index in the data matrix. \n",
